# Eye-Exercise

## This activity was to create two eyes that will follow the cursor. The eyes are centered to the screen and the pupils move as the cursor moves as if they are watching the cursor.

<img src= "eyes.png" width= '300' />

//How to Run: Upload the code to a blank browser, and it will show you two eyes. As you move the cursor around the screen the pupils will follow the cursor.
